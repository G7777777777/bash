Defanging an IP address is a process of modifying the IP address so that it is not clickable or executable in a way that could potentially cause harm if clicked accidentally. Below is a simple Python script that defangs an IP address. This script can be run on Kali Linux or any other system with Python installed.

Here's a Python script that you can use to defang an IP address:

```python
import re

def defang_ip(ip):
    # Use regex to find all occurrences of IP addresses in the input string
    defanged_ip = re.sub(r'\.', '[.]', ip)
    return defanged_ip

def main():
    ip = input("Enter the IP address to defang: ")
    defanged_ip = defang_ip(ip)
    print(f"Defanged IP address: {defanged_ip}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `defang_ip.py`. You can then run it from the terminal on Kali Linux using the following command:

```sh
python3 defang_ip.py
```

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the IP address you want to defang, and it will output the defanged IP address.
